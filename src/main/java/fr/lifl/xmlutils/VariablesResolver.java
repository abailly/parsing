/**
 * A class for resolving special URI corresponding to variable instances.
 * <p>
 * This class allows resolving of XML entities whose <em>system URI</em>
 * starts with the scheme <code>file:</code> or <code>property:</code>.
 * These URIs are resolved against the current classpath. In the first case, the
 * content is provided asis, while in the second case the corresponding property
 * file is transformed on the fly in an XML fragment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An URI as <code>classpath://path/to/resource</code> is resolved against the
 * classloader's classpath as <code>path/to/resource</code> (not that there is
 * no leading '/').
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An URI as <code>property://path/to/property</code> is resolved against the
 * classloader's classpath as <code>path/to/property</code>then loaded using
 * {@link java.util.ResourceBundle} class, which means the real name of the
 * loaded property depends on the current locale settings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All other URIs are left to the system's resolver.
